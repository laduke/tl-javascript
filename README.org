* Personal javascript spacemacs layer 
  Started from scratch. js-mode knows jsx now.
** install
   symlink into ~/.emacs.d/private/layers
*** needs this variable set when including in dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    #+begin_src lisp
      (tl-javascript :variables node-add-modules-path t)
    #+end_src
** js dependencies
   #+begin_src sh
     npm i -g eslint_d prettier tsserver
   #+end_src
   probably more
*** package.json
    something like this
    #+begin_src  json
      {
        "devDependencies": {
          "eslint-config-standard": "^12.0.0",
          "standard": "^12.0.1"
        },
        "eslintConfig": {
          "extends": "standard"
        }
      }
    #+end_src
*** jsconfig.json
    just an empty one `{}` seems to be enough for tide. I don't know much about tide, but the autocomplete seems to be working well.
